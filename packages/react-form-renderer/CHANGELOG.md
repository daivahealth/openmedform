## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1e62675: Remove the Form.io engine. JSON Forms is now the only engine (ADR-004).

  **Breaking:**

  - `FormDefinition` is no longer a discriminated union. The `engine` field, the
    `FormEngine` type, and the `isFormioDefinition` / `isJsonFormsDefinition`
    narrowing helpers are gone. `JsonFormsFormDefinition` is kept as an alias of
    `FormDefinition`, so imports of that name keep resolving — drop `engine:
'jsonforms'` from any definition you construct.
  - `FormRenderer` no longer accepts `patientContext` or `onSubmit`. Those
    belonged to the Form.io branch, which owned the patient banner and the submit
    lifecycle; render your own submit control and call your own handler.
  - `FormioBranch` and its props type are no longer exported.
  - `FormInstance` no longer carries `engine`.

  **Not breaking:**

  - `@openmedform/react-form-renderer/jsonforms` still resolves — it is now an
    alias of the package root, which is Form.io-free by construction.
  - The `omf` UI vocabulary, all clinical controls, the design tokens and the
    print engine are unchanged.

  Migration for an EMR integration is usually a two-line diff: delete
  `engine: 'jsonforms'` from the definition you build, and move your submit button
  out of the renderer.

### Minor Changes

- bdfcfd2: Add `recordTable` — the repeating clinical encounter log — plus `OmfTabsLayout`.

  A source form that carries a table the user adds rows to (a treatment day, a
  medication round, an observation entry) now renders as that table in both
  renderers: a toolbar with a live count and an add button, one summary row per
  record, and an expandable inline detail panel with a Close button. Previously an
  array of objects fell through to the stock JSON Forms list widget
  ("Add to … / Items / Valid / No data"), which looks nothing like the source.

  - `options.omf.control: "recordTable"` with `omf.recordTable`
    (`addLabel`, `countLabel`, `emptyLabel`, `removeConfirm`, `columns`). Columns
    read a dot path inside one record, with `pairWith` for a combined `A / B`
    header and `countOf` for a header that counts nested records.
  - `options.detail` holds the per-record UI schema — typically an `OmfTabsLayout`,
    a new layout that turns its children into tab pages titled by their labels.
  - Record tables nest: a treatment day's drug list is itself a `recordTable`, and
    the parent's "Drugs" column counts it.
  - Summary-cell derivation, record seeding and the count line live once in
    `@openmedform/form-core` (`record-table/summary.ts`) and are shared by both
    renderers, so a log cannot read differently in an EMR than in the web preview.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- b74ba2d: Render source tables as real grids, and add table support to the Angular renderer.

  `OmfTableLayout` gains `options.omf.columns` (`{ label, width, align }[]`). With
  columns declared it renders a true grid — a header row plus ONE cell per child,
  aligned to the columns — instead of the previous two-cell (row label | all
  contents) layout that stacked and wrapped every field. Cell controls no longer
  repeat their own label, since the column header already names them. Column
  widths and alignment carry over from the source, and a wide table scrolls inside
  its own container rather than pushing the host page sideways. Omitting `columns`
  keeps the existing left-label behaviour unchanged.

  The Angular renderer previously had **no** `OmfTableLayout` renderer at all, so
  any form containing a table fell through to "No applicable renderer found!".
  It now implements the same two modes as React.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 454223a: Memoize live-scoring work in the React renderer.

  `OmfScoreSummary` re-walked the entire UI schema (`collectScoreItems`) and
  `OmfGroup` re-walked its subtree on every render — and `useJsonForms()` re-renders
  these on every JsonForms state change (validation/focus/config, not just data
  edits). Both are now wrapped in `useMemo`: the tree walk runs only when the UI
  schema reference changes and the sum only when the response data changes.
  Behaviour is unchanged (same totals/subtotals/risk band) — this mirrors the
  equivalent Angular renderer fix so both stay cheap on large scored forms.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- aa88f31: Add a `checklistMatrix` control for periodic-reassessment grids.

  New `options.omf.control: "checklistMatrix"` renders a rows × columns checkbox
  grid (e.g. Nursing Diagnosis × Day 1–5), configured via `options.omf.rows` /
  `options.omf.columns` and bound to an object value `{ [rowKey]: { [colKey]: true } }`.
  Rendered identically in the React and Angular renderers. The jsonforms conversion
  prompt now uses it for daily/periodic reassessment tables and extracts dense
  multi-page sections (side-by-side contraindication/orders boxes, long medication
  lists) exhaustively instead of leaving later sections empty.
