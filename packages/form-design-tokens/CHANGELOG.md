### Major Changes

- 1e62675: Remove the Form.io engine. JSON Forms is now the only engine (ADR-004).

  **Breaking:**

  - `FormDefinition` is no longer a discriminated union. The `engine` field, the
    `FormEngine` type, and the `isFormioDefinition` / `isJsonFormsDefinition`
    narrowing helpers are gone. `JsonFormsFormDefinition` is kept as an alias of
    `FormDefinition`, so imports of that name keep resolving — drop `engine:
'jsonforms'` from any definition you construct.
  - `FormRenderer` no longer accepts `patientContext` or `onSubmit`. Those
    belonged to the Form.io branch, which owned the patient banner and the submit
    lifecycle; render your own submit control and call your own handler.
  - `FormioBranch` and its props type are no longer exported.
  - `FormInstance` no longer carries `engine`.

  **Not breaking:**

  - `@openmedform/react-form-renderer/jsonforms` still resolves — it is now an
    alias of the package root, which is Form.io-free by construction.
  - The `omf` UI vocabulary, all clinical controls, the design tokens and the
    print engine are unchanged.

  Migration for an EMR integration is usually a two-line diff: delete
  `engine: 'jsonforms'` from the definition you build, and move your submit button
  out of the renderer.
